## Deploy(from windows)
**Prerequisites**
Ensure you have the following:

- PuTTY installed for SSH access.
- FileZilla installed for transferring files via SFTP.
- A private key file (.pem file) converted to a PuTTY-compatible .ppk file.

    2. Upload Files:
        - Navigate to the local build directory in the local pane.
        - Navigate to /home/ubuntu/build/ in the remote pane.
        Drag and drop all files from the local dist directory to the remote build directory.

4. Deploy to Web Directory

    2. Execute Deployment Command:
        Run the following command to move the files to the serverâ€™s web directory:

        `sudo cp -r /home/ubuntu/build/* /var/www/html/`
